                Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the Asgardians, 
                <br>a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.
                <br>Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known as 
                <br>Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir,
                <br>which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. 
                <br>When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard
                <br>(more commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,
                <br>stripped of his memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly powers.
                <br>Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers, 
                <br>"Earth's Mightiest Heroes
